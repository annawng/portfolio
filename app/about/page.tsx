              Hello! I&apos;m Anna, a senior studying Computer Science at the
              University of Washington. With a background in full-stack
              development, UI/UX design, accessibility, and design systems, I
              love working alongside designers and engineers to build intuitive,
              enjoyable experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              Last summer, I joined Mark43 as a UX Engineering Intern, where I
              contributed to the design system used across the company&apos;s
              public safety products. I loved getting to work on the entire
              process of creating components: discussing with the engineering
              and product teams about the use cases and desired features,
              designing in Figma, developing in React, and creating interactive
              examples with documentation in Storybook. I also had the
              opportunity to apply my experience in web accessibility testing to
              increase WCAG compliance across the component library.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I&apos;m not coding or designing, you&apos;ll probably find
              me listening to music (63,227 minutes last year), making Spotify
              playlists (I have over 350â€”is that concerning?), or playing
              instruments (mostly piano and guitar).
