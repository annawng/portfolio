                Hello! I&apos;m Anna, a senior studying Computer Science at the
                University of Washington. With a background in full-stack
                development, UI/UX design, accessibility testing, and design
                systems, I love working alongside designers and engineers to
                build intuitive, enjoyable experiences.
              </p>
              <p>
                Last summer, I joined Mark43 as a UX Engineering Intern, where I
                contributed to the design system used across the company&apos;s
                public safety products. I loved getting to work on the entire
                process of creating components: discussing with the engineering
                and product teams about the use cases and intended behavior,
                designing in Figma, developing in React, and creating
                interactive examples with documentation in Storybook. I also had
                the opportunity to apply my expertise in web accessibility to
                increase WCAG compliance across the component library.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I&apos;m not coding or designing, you&apos;ll probably find
                me listening to music (63,227 minutes last year), making Spotify
                playlists (I have over 350â€”is that concerning?), or playing
                instruments (mostly piano and guitar).
